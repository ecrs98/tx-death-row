# TX Death Row Last Words: Topic Analysis
Text analysis project of Texas death row prisoners' last words before execution (state murder). The project consists of two main technical components - scraping prisoner data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website, and conducting a topic analysis of the resulting corpus. The corpus ranges in time from December 1982 to June 2024. The average number of executions per year has been [x]. [x][year] saw the most executions at [x]; [x][year] the least at [x]. [x]% of those executed have been Black, [x]% white, and [x]% belong to the wide yet narrowly applied category "Hispanic." The average age of those executed has been [x]. As of June 2024, the rate of executions seems to be [x][increasing/decreasing].

Topic analysis interests are the following
* Glean broad knowledge of Texas death row prisoners' final sentiments - (e.g. were they remorseful?)
* Test hypotheses about final sentiments varying by race
* See changing trends over time
